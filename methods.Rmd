# Methods

This section summarizes the statistical and machine learning methods used in the analysis of Jargon user data.

## ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- Used to compare means of continuous features (e.g., daily goal, density) across user groups.

## Chi-Squared Test
- Used to assess associations between categorical variables (e.g., highlight style vs. user group).

## Ordinal Regression
- Used to model the relationship between user group (ordered: Regular, Active, Very Active) and user features (e.g., daily goal, density, highlight style).

## K-means Clustering
- Used to segment users into groups based on engagement metrics, identifying clusters of similar behavior.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Used to reduce dimensionality and visualize user engagement patterns in two dimensions.

## LDA Topic Modeling
- Used to identify latent topics in user-selected sentences, revealing common themes in content engagement.

## Correlation Analysis
- Used to measure the strength and direction of relationships between user features and engagement metrics.
